Homework 1:
2. Static methods or fields are unique to a class, not to an instance of a class.
3. Association is a relationship between two classes where one uses the other in some way.
4. Polymorphism allows having the same names for many distinct methods which take different types of parameters.
Also applicable when willing to slightly modify a superclass' method in a subclass by overriding.
5. In inheritance, one class is deemed as a subclass of another, thus receiving all the variables and methods present present there.
In association, one class uses another class in some way and receives only the variables and methods it refers to.
6. They are both different cases of polymorphism. In overloading, methods with the same name can have similar names but
different signatures. In overriding, subclasses can have same methods as their superclasses but modified.
7. A lion has cubs, a squirrel has peanuts. A lion is a cat. A squirrel is a mammal.
A program has users. A folder has files. A game is an application. A search engine is a web page.
